# ClimateSphere

### Personalized Indoor Comfort Through Thread, Matter, and Edge Intelligence

## Project Overview

ClimateSphere is an occupancy-aware indoor environmental control system that creates personalized micro-climate zones within shared spaces such as offices, classrooms, libraries, and co-working environments.

Traditional HVAC and lighting systems typically treat an entire room as a single zone, often resulting in uneven comfort levels and unnecessary energy consumption. ClimateSphere addresses this challenge by continuously monitoring temperature, humidity, ambient light, and occupancy conditions through a network of Silicon Labs EFR32MG24-based Thread sensor nodes.

Environmental data is transmitted over a self-healing Thread mesh network to an EFR32MG26 Edge Controller, where local intelligence analyzes room conditions and occupancy patterns. Based on these insights, Matter-enabled devices such as smart fans, lighting systems, and ventilation controls automatically adjust environmental conditions around occupied areas.

By conditioning only the spaces that are actively being used, ClimateSphere improves occupant comfort while reducing energy waste.

## Real-World Example

Consider an office with multiple workstations:

* Desk A is occupied and the user prefers a cooler environment.
* Desk B is occupied with standard comfort requirements.
* Desk C is currently vacant.

ClimateSphere detects occupancy and environmental conditions at each desk, increasing airflow around Desk A while maintaining normal conditions at Desk B and disabling localized conditioning at Desk C. This provides personalized comfort without unnecessarily cooling the entire office.
